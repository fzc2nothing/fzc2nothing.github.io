## CS 61B 第二节课：

* Defning Class

* Constructor: Java provides every class with a default constructor, which takes no parameters and does no initialization

* The "this" Keyword: `You CANNOT change the value of "this"`. 

* The "static" Keyword: `A static field is a single variable shared by a whole class of objects.` It is a value that does not change from object to object. It can be changed while each object will have the same value. Methods can be static as well. A static method doesn't implicitly pass an object as a parameter. `The main() method is also static.` There no "This" in a static method.

## LeetCode

### 66. Plus One
Nothing to say, just play with array. Remember to deal with array directly. It is hard to find a proper container for the number.
```
    class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        
        int n = digits.length;
        
        for(int i = n-1; i>=0; i--) {
            
        if(digits[i] <9) {
            digits[i] ++;
            return digits;
        }
            
            digits[i] = 0;
        }
        
        int[] res = new int[n+1];
        
        res[0] = 1;
        
        return res;
        
        }
    }
```
